# API Project

This project is a Python-based API, structured with a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Follow the steps below to set up the project from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.11 or higher recommended)
- `requirements.txt` with required dependencies

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to create the API project with `app.py` and `requirements.txt`:

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into your project directory where `app.py` and `requirements.txt` are located:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment in the project directory:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv/Scripts/activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Use `requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application
Start the application by running `app.py`:
```bash
python app.py
```

### 6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)
After you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file for the API.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the dependencies for the project.
- `venv/`: Virtual environment directory (excluded from version control).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders to ignore in version control.

## .gitignore

Ensure the following items are in your `.gitignore` to avoid unnecessary files in version control:

```plaintext
# Virtual environment
venv/

# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# Environment variables and sensitive files
.env

# Ignore macOS files
.DS_Store

# Ignore logs and debug files
*.log

# Ignore IDE or editor configuration
.vscode/
.idea/

# Ignore compiled Python files
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Ignore Jupyter notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```
